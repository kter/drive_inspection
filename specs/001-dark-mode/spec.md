# Feature Specification: Dark Mode Support with Theme Settings

**Feature Branch**: `001-dark-mode`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "夜間のドライブの時、まぶしかったので、OS側のダークモードの状態に合わせるようにしてください。また設定画面を用意しライトモード、ダークモード、自動モードを切り替えられるようにしてください"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Dark Mode During Night Driving (Priority: P1)

A user drives at night and finds the bright screen uncomfortable and distracting while monitoring their driving performance. The application needs to automatically adapt its appearance to reduce glare and eye strain during nighttime use.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary pain point identified by the user - bright screens during night driving create a safety concern and poor user experience. This directly addresses the core problem.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by enabling system dark mode and launching the app - the app should immediately display with a dark color scheme without requiring any user configuration. Delivers immediate value by reducing screen brightness during night driving.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the device's operating system is set to dark mode, **When** the user launches the app, **Then** all screens display with a dark theme (dark backgrounds, light text)
2. **Given** the app is running with light theme, **When** the user switches the device OS to dark mode, **Then** the app automatically transitions to dark theme without requiring restart
3. **Given** the app is running with dark theme, **When** the user switches the device OS to light mode, **Then** the app automatically transitions to light theme without requiring restart
4. **Given** the app is in dark mode, **When** viewing the acceleration display screen, **Then** all UI elements (gauges, charts, trajectory) are visible and readable with appropriate contrast

### User Story 2 - Manual Theme Override in Settings (Priority: P2)

A user wants to control the app's appearance independently from their device settings, allowing them to keep their phone in light mode while using dark mode in the driving app during daytime drives through tunnels or shaded areas.

**Why this priority**: Provides user control and flexibility. While automatic mode solves most cases, users may have specific preferences or situations where they want to override the system setting.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to settings and selecting a theme preference. The app should respect this choice regardless of system settings. Delivers value by giving users control over their viewing experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the app, **When** they navigate to settings, **Then** they see a theme selection option with three choices: Light, Dark, and Auto (follow system)
2. **Given** the user is in settings, **When** they select "Light" theme, **Then** the app immediately displays with light theme regardless of system setting
3. **Given** the user is in settings, **When** they select "Dark" theme, **Then** the app immediately displays with dark theme regardless of system setting
4. **Given** the user is in settings, **When** they select "Auto" theme, **Then** the app follows the device's system dark mode setting
5. **Given** the user has set a manual theme preference, **When** they restart the app, **Then** the app remembers and applies their saved theme preference

### User Story 3 - Settings Screen Access (Priority: P2)

A user needs an intuitive way to access theme settings while using the app, without disrupting their driving session or navigation flow.

**Why this priority**: Essential for P2 to function, but less critical than the core theme functionality itself. The settings must be discoverable but doesn't need to be the primary focus.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by launching the app and locating the settings entry point. User should be able to access settings, see available options, and return to the main screen. Delivers value by making configuration accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the main acceleration display screen, **When** they look for settings, **Then** they find a clearly visible settings icon or menu option
2. **Given** the user is on the main screen, **When** they tap the settings option, **Then** they navigate to a settings screen
3. **Given** the user is in the settings screen, **When** they tap the back button or navigation action, **Then** they return to the screen they came from
4. **Given** the user is viewing session history, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can navigate to settings and return to history without losing their place

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the device changes dark mode setting while the app is in the background (e.g., automatic time-based dark mode)?
  - App should detect the change and update theme when returning to foreground
- How does the system handle theme transitions during an active driving session with live data updating?
  - Theme transition should be smooth without interrupting data collection or causing UI flickering
- What happens if the user rapidly switches between theme options multiple times?
  - App should handle rapid changes gracefully without crashing or freezing
- How are theme colors chosen for visualization elements (trajectory, gauges, event markers)?
  - Colors must maintain sufficient contrast and readability in both light and dark modes
- What happens when viewing saved session history in different themes?
  - Historical data should display correctly regardless of theme, with appropriate contrast for all data visualization elements

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and respond to the device's operating system dark mode setting
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a settings screen accessible from the main application screens
- **FR-003**: System MUST offer three theme options: Light mode, Dark mode, and Auto (follow system)
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist the user's theme preference across app restarts
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply theme changes immediately without requiring app restart
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide appropriate color schemes for both light and dark themes that maintain readability of all UI elements
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply consistent theming across all screens (acceleration display, session history, settings, error screens)
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain adequate contrast ratios for text, icons, and data visualizations in both themes
- **FR-009**: System MUST update the theme when device system settings change while the app is running
- **FR-010**: System MUST default to "Auto" theme mode on first launch (follow system dark mode)

### Key Entities

- **Theme Preference**: User's saved choice for theme mode (Light, Dark, or Auto)
  - Attributes: Selected mode, last modified timestamp
  - Persisted locally on the device

- **Theme Configuration**: Color definitions and styling parameters for each theme
  - Attributes: Background colors, text colors, accent colors, visualization colors
  - Separate configurations for Light and Dark modes

- **System Theme State**: Current operating system dark mode setting
  - Attributes: Is dark mode enabled (boolean)
  - Monitored and synchronized with app theme when in Auto mode

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can launch the app during night driving and see a dark interface within 1 second, without any manual configuration
- **SC-002**: 100% of screens and UI components display correctly in both light and dark themes with no visual glitches
- **SC-003**: Theme transitions complete within 300 milliseconds without disrupting ongoing data collection or UI updates
- **SC-004**: Users can locate and access theme settings within 3 taps from any main screen
- **SC-005**: User theme preferences persist correctly across 100% of app restarts
- **SC-006**: All text maintains minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio in both themes (WCAG AA standard)
- **SC-007**: App correctly responds to system theme changes within 1 second when returning from background
- **SC-008**: Data visualizations (trajectory, charts, gauges) maintain full readability in both themes with appropriate color adjustments
