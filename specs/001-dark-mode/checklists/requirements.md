# Specification Quality Checklist: Dark Mode Support with Theme Settings

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Review**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without mentioning specific technologies
- ✅ Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Review**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and complete
- ✅ All 10 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "within 1 second", "4.5:1 contrast ratio", "100% of screens")
- ✅ All success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on user outcomes rather than implementation
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with clear conditions
- ✅ Edge cases section identifies 5 key boundary conditions
- ✅ Scope is bounded to dark mode support and theme settings
- ✅ Assumptions documented in entity definitions (e.g., "Auto mode" as default)

**Feature Readiness Review**:
- ✅ Each of the 10 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios prioritized (P1, P2) and independently testable
- ✅ 8 measurable success criteria defined covering performance, reliability, and usability
- ✅ No implementation leakage detected

## Status

**READY FOR PLANNING** ✅

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
