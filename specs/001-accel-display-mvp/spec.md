# Feature Specification: Real-time Acceleration Display MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-accel-display-mvp`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Honda Motor Co.,Ltd.が開発したRoadPerformanceというモバイルアプリに類似したiOS, AndroidアプリをFlutterで作成したいです。Flutterのinitは済ませました。MVP開発をしたいので、まずは加速度センサーを使って今どんな加速度かを表示するシンプルなアプリを作成したいです。将来的には加速度の履歴から運転スコアを出したりランキング機能を実装したいですが、MVPのあtめ、まずはGセンサーだけを実装したいです。画面では今どれ位の加速度がどちらに掛かっているかを軌跡付きで表示するだけに留めたいです。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Real-time Acceleration (Priority: P1)

A driver wants to monitor the G-forces (acceleration) their vehicle experiences in real-time during driving. The app displays current acceleration magnitude and direction with a visual trajectory showing recent movement patterns.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the MVP. Without real-time acceleration display, the app provides no value to users. This is the foundation for all future features like driving score calculation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the app and observing acceleration values change as the device is moved in different directions. Delivers immediate value by showing real-time G-force data with trajectory visualization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is launched and sensor permission is granted, **When** the device is stationary, **Then** the display shows minimal acceleration (close to 0g in horizontal directions, approximately 1g in vertical direction due to gravity)
2. **Given** the app is displaying acceleration data, **When** the device is moved forward, **Then** the display shows acceleration in the forward direction with appropriate magnitude and updates the trajectory visualization
3. **Given** the app is displaying acceleration data, **When** the device is moved left, **Then** the display shows acceleration in the left direction with appropriate magnitude and updates the trajectory visualization
4. **Given** the app is displaying acceleration data, **When** the device is moved right, **Then** the display shows acceleration in the right direction with appropriate magnitude and updates the trajectory visualization
5. **Given** the app is displaying acceleration data, **When** the device experiences rapid deceleration (braking), **Then** the display shows negative acceleration with appropriate magnitude and updates the trajectory visualization
6. **Given** the user has been using the app, **When** they view the acceleration display, **Then** they can see a trajectory path showing recent acceleration history

### User Story 2 - Handle Sensor Permissions (Priority: P1)

A user opening the app for the first time or after denying sensor permissions needs clear guidance on granting the necessary permissions for the app to function.

**Why this priority**: Without sensor access, the app cannot function at all. This is a critical prerequisite for P1 core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by installing the app fresh and verifying permission request flow. Delivers value by ensuring users can grant necessary permissions to use the app.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is launched for the first time, **When** sensor permission is required, **Then** the app requests permission with clear explanation of why it's needed
2. **Given** sensor permission is denied, **When** the user tries to use the app, **Then** the app displays a message explaining that sensor access is required and provides instructions to enable it in settings
3. **Given** sensor permission is granted, **When** the app is launched, **Then** the app immediately begins displaying acceleration data

### User Story 3 - Handle Sensor Errors (Priority: P2)

Users need to be informed when the acceleration sensor is unavailable or malfunctioning, so they understand why the app isn't working as expected.

**Why this priority**: While important for user experience, this is a fallback scenario that doesn't prevent core functionality in normal operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested on devices without accelerometer support or by simulating sensor failure. Delivers value by providing clear error messaging rather than silent failure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the device has no accelerometer, **When** the app is launched, **Then** the app displays a message indicating that the device is not compatible
2. **Given** the accelerometer encounters an error during operation, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the app displays an error message and provides options to retry or exit
3. **Given** sensor readings are unreliable or unstable, **When** the app detects inconsistent data, **Then** the app displays a warning to the user about potential sensor issues

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the device loses sensor access while the app is running?
- How does the system handle extremely high acceleration values that exceed typical driving scenarios?
- What happens if the device orientation changes rapidly during use?
- How does the app behave when running in the background or when the screen is locked?
- What happens when the device battery is critically low?
- How does the trajectory visualization handle very long continuous usage sessions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST access the device's accelerometer sensor to read real-time acceleration data
- **FR-002**: System MUST display current acceleration magnitude in G-forces (gravitational force units)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display acceleration direction (forward/backward, left/right)
- **FR-004**: System MUST update acceleration readings in real-time at 30 Hz (30 updates per second) for smooth visualization
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a visual trajectory showing the path of recent acceleration changes
- **FR-006**: System MUST request accelerometer sensor permissions from the user
- **FR-007**: System MUST display appropriate error messages when sensor permissions are denied
- **FR-008**: System MUST display appropriate error messages when the accelerometer is unavailable or malfunctioning
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle sensor data even when device orientation changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST work on both iOS and Android platforms
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual representation distinguishing between different acceleration directions
- **FR-012**: System MUST clear or manage trajectory history to prevent performance degradation during extended use sessions
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to see the current G-force value at a glance while focusing on driving

### Key Entities

- **Acceleration Reading**: Represents a single point-in-time measurement from the accelerometer, including magnitude (in G-forces), direction (x, y, z axes or derived forward/back, left/right), and timestamp
- **Trajectory Point**: Represents a historical acceleration data point used for visualization, including position coordinates and timestamp for rendering the acceleration path

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can see acceleration updates within 100 milliseconds of actual vehicle movement
- **SC-002**: The app displays acceleration values accurately within ±0.1g of actual acceleration
- **SC-003**: The trajectory visualization clearly shows the last 10 seconds of acceleration history
- **SC-004**: 95% of users can successfully grant sensor permissions and begin viewing acceleration data within 30 seconds of app launch
- **SC-005**: The app runs continuously for at least 1 hour without performance degradation or crashes
- **SC-006**: The display remains readable and updates smoothly during typical driving acceleration scenarios (0-3g range)
- **SC-007**: Users can distinguish between forward, backward, left, and right acceleration by visual indicators alone

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Users will primarily use this app while in a vehicle (driving or as a passenger)
- The device will be mounted securely in the vehicle in a consistent orientation
- Standard mobile device accelerometers provide sufficient accuracy for driving scenario measurements
- Users understand basic physics concepts of acceleration and G-forces, or the visual representation alone is intuitive enough without requiring extensive explanation
- The app will run in the foreground during use (background operation is out of scope for MVP)
- Network connectivity is not required for core functionality
- Data persistence (saving historical data) is not required for MVP
